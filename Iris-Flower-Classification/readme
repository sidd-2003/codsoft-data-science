Iris flower classification is a fundamental task in the fields of machine learning and botany. It involves the identification and categorization of iris flowers into different species based on their physical characteristics. The most common iris dataset used for this classification task is the Iris dataset, which was introduced by the British biologist and statistician Ronald A. Fisher in 1936.

The dataset consists of measurements of four features from three different species of iris flowers:
Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width

The three species of iris in the dataset are:
Iris Setosa
Iris Versicolor
Iris Virginica

The goal of iris flower classification is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify iris flowers into one of these three species based on the four feature measurements. This classification task is typically approached using machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and neural networks. It serves as a common benchmark problem in machine learning and is often used to teach and practice various classification techniques.

Iris flower classification has practical applications in botany, horticulture, and agriculture, where it helps researchers and professionals identify and differentiate iris species, as well as in machine learning education to introduce beginners to classification problems and techniques.
